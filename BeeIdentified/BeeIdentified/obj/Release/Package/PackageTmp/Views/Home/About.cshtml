    IdentiBee is a tool for identifying bees you have seen. It helps users keep track of bee sightings and other associated information.
    This includes the type of bee, date, location, and number of bees. When you see a new bee, just click on the "I saw something!" button and
    enter information about what you've seen. Our tool will help you narrow your search. Once you're sure about what you've seen, you can select the
    "This was it!" button and it will be added to your history. It's as simple as that!
